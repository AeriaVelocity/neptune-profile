            <h2>Profile</h2>
            <p>The CPU of Planeptune, the Land of Purple Progress. Neptune's the protag here, and the main muse, so you'd best be treating me-- I mean, her with respect, ya hear?</p>
            <p>At some point, Neptune was hit with some kind of weird energy, which gave her these crazy strong abilities! But maaan, does it tire her out quick. . .</p>
            <p>Being the awesome protag she is, Neptune uses a single sword (usually made of wood) as her weapon of choice!</p>
            <h2>Forms</h2>
            <h3>Older Form</h3>
            <img src="olderform.jpg" alt="Older Form Neptune" class="full-width">
            <p>Neptune obtained this transformation one Halloween night, when some unknown force completely transformed her body!</p>
            <p>In this form, Neptune's quite a bit stronger, and she gets dual blades and a pistol! Which is super cool!</p>
            <p>Her childlike innocence is still there, though! It's everything you loved about the original Neptune, just in a bigger package!</p>
            <p>. . .What do you mean, "that's just Ultra Dimension Neptune"?</p>
            <h3>Purple Heart</h3>
            <img src="purpleheart.jpg" alt="Purple Heart" class="full-width">
            <p>Neptune's Goddess Form! She's <em>super</em> powerful in this form and the only thing that can really match her full power is another CPU!</p>
            <p>Neptune gets a heck of a lot mature in this form, and is the most level-headed CPU out of the main four. Her whole personality does a complete 180!</p>
            <p>Despite all that, and despite ruling over Planeptune for many, many years, she's still pretty rough around the edges even <em>in</em> this form, especially when compared to her Hyper Dimension counterpart.</p>
            <p>Even Neptune isn't sure what the full extent of her power is. . .</p>
            <p>As Purple Heart, she pretty much always uses her super duper powerful sword that cuts through anything like butter, and like butter like water, and through water like air!</p>
            <h3>NEXT Purple</h3>
            <img src="nextpurple.jpg" alt="NEXT Purple" class="full-width">
            <p>Neptune is able to access an imperfect NEXT Form on certain occasions.</p>
            <p>She's not able to activate this form if she is even a little bit Corrupted, and she's not even sure how it's invoked otherwise. Usually it's a mixture of luck and determination.</p>
            <p>Most of Neptune's knowledge about NEXT Form is from what she's heard from Hyper Dimension's Neptune, and even so, that knowledge is heavily limited.</p>
            <p>NEXT Purple's strength is comparable to Neptune in her Corrupted State, but her lack of experience in this form makes it an unwise decision to use in most circumstances.</p>
            <h2>Unique Abilities</h2>
            <h3>Game Index</h3>
            <p>Neptune can steal the powers of video game characters to use for herself!</p>
            <p>If the power she steals is from a game series published from Planeptune (SEGA), Neptune will be able to use it with perfect efficiency.</p>
            <p>Her Older Form also increases her Game Index proficiency, and allows her to steal gun-wielding characters' abilities, too.</p>
            <h3>Corruption/Corrupted State</h3>
            <p>Neptune's Corruption is her manifested anger turned into power. This happened as a side-effect of Neptune obtaining her Older Form.</p>
            <p>If Neptune's Corruption gets to a state where she can't keep it under control any longer, she enters her Corrupted State.</p>
            <p>In Corrupted State, Neptune's strength increases <em>exponentially</em>, surpassing even the strongest opponent or weapon, and her vision and mind become totally clouded, unable to feel anything other than pure, unadulterated anger.</p>
            <p>However, since she feeds directly on her Corruption, Neptune only has a short amount of time in her Corrupted State if it isn't being constantly fuelled. Exiting her Corrupted State usually makes Neptune collapse from exhaustion.</p>
            <p>Corrupted State <strong>completely locks out</strong> Neptune's Goddess Form, and she's unable to become Corrupted if she's currently in it.</p>
