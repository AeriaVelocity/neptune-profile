            <h2>Profile</h2>
            <p>The CPU of Ultra Dimension's Planeptune, and Neptune's cross-dimensional counterpart! She's practically Nep's cousin!</p>
            <p>As far as fighting goes, Plutia smacks mean bad guys with her assortment of plushies! Those things hurt a <em>lot</em>, by the way. It's almost as if she stuffed 'em with rocks. . .</p>
            <h2>Forms</h2>
            <h3>Older Form</h3>
            <blockquote style="padding: 30px 0">No pic. Sorry. :&lpar;</blockquote>
            <p>Just like Neptune, Plutia can tap into an Older Form anytime she likes!</p>
            <p>She's way less childish in this form, and she's less sleepy, too. All that blast-processing technology's gotta do something, right?</p>
            <p>She keeps her Human Form's. . . <em>decency</em>, but she's got the rockin' good looks and brains of her Goddess Form!</p>
            <p>In her Older Form, Plutia now has a scythe as her main weapon. She does still keep some plushies on hand, though. Y'know, just in case.</p>
            <h3>Iris Heart</h3>
            <img src="irisheart.webp" alt="Iris Heart" class="full-width">
            <p>Plutia's Goddess Form, Iris Heart! If you encounter her, and you're not in her good books, best run for the hills!</p>
            <p>She's suuuper sadistic in this form, and if she catches you, you'd better be in for a world of pain!</p>
            <p>Buuut, she ain't all that mean. If you're someone she cares about, she'll drop everything to protect you!</p>
            <p>And weapons? Well, no more of that plushie stuff! If you're up against Iris Heart, prepare to be thrashed wildly by her super spiky whip! She can grab enemies in a chokehold from a distance and give 'em a good whipping all over!</p>
            <h2>Unique Abilities</h2>
            <p>Nothing much yet. I might come up with something down the line.</p>
