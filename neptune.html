                Neptune<br>

            <p align="center"><a href="index.html">Back to main page</a></p>
            <p align="center"><em>"It's dangerous to go alone. Take Nep!"</em></p>
            <h2>Profile</h2>
            <p>The CPU of Planeptune, the Land of Purple Progress. Neptune's the protag here, and the main muse, so you'd best be treating me-- I mean, her with respect, ya hear?</p>
            <p>Being the awesome protag she is, Neptune uses a single sword (usually made of wood) as her weapon of choice, 'cause she's cool like that!</p>
            <h2>Forms</h2>
            <h3>Ultra Dimension</h3>
            <img src="olderform.jpg" alt="Neptune (Ultra Dimension)" class="full-width">
            <p>Wait, what's Ultra Nep doing here? She's another person, not a transformation! What, we couldn't just add another page for her?</p>
            <p>Aaaaanyway... this is Ultra Dimension Neptune! She's Neptune, from the Ultra Dimension, where she was never a Goddess!</p>
            <p>This Neptune's quite a bit stronger than her Super Dimension counterpart, and she gets dual blades and a pistol! Which is super cool! It's like Nepu May Cry over here!</p>
            <p>Her childlike innocence is still there, though! It's everything you loved about the original Neptune, just in a bigger package!</p>
            <h3>Purple Heart</h3>
            <img src="purpleheart.jpg" alt="Purple Heart" class="full-width">
            <p>Neptune's Goddess Form! She's <em>super</em> powerful in this form and the only thing that can really match her full power is another CPU!</p>
            <p>Neptune gets a heck of a lot mature in this form, and is the most level-headed CPU out of the main four. Her whole personality does a complete 180!</p>
            <p>Despite all that, and despite ruling over Planeptune for many, many years, she's still pretty rough around the edges even <em>in</em> this form, especially when compared to her Hyper Dimension counterpart.</p>
            <p>Even Neptune isn't sure what the full extent of her power is...</p>
            <p>As Purple Heart, she pretty much always uses her super duper powerful sword that cuts through anything like butter, and like butter like water, and through water like air, and through air like <code>[NULL]</code>!</p>
            <h3>NEXT Purple</h3>
            <img src="nextpurple.jpg" alt="NEXT Purple" class="full-width">
            <p><strike>Wait, that's not canon.</strike></p>
            <p>Neptune is able to access an imperfect NEXT Form on certain occasions.</p>
            <p>She's only able to access this form if she's fully level-headed, and she's not even sure how it's invoked otherwise. Usually it's a mixture of luck and determination.</p>
            <p>Most of Neptune's knowledge about NEXT Form is from what she's heard from Hyper Dimension's Neptune, and even so, that knowledge is heavily limited.</p>
            <h2>Weapons</h2>
            <h3>As Neptune</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Wooden Sword</strong> - A wooden sword Neptune found in a dumpster. For whatever reason, she loves it. Neptune's former default weapon.</li>
                <li><strong>Dimension Slicer</strong> - A futuristic energy katana created by an acquaintance of Neptune. It shares the technology of Nepgear's Beam Sword, and bears her round N logo on the side of the guard. Neptune's current main weapon.</li>
                <li><strong>Hunting Sword</strong> - Neptune bought this sword in a store, since the stats were decent. Right now, it's a very sharp paperweight.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>As Purple Heart</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>CPU Blade</strong> (or whatever that sword is called) - A sword forged through Neptune's innate Share Energy, accessible only as Purple Heart. It bears a strong resemblance to her Processor Unit in its colour scheme.</li>
                <li><strong>Dimension Slicer EXE</strong> - An upgraded version of the Dimension Slicer, intertwined with Neptune's overflowing Share Energy while she's in Purple Heart form.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Unique Abilities</h2>
            <h3>Game Index</h3>
            <p>Neptune can steal the powers of video game characters to use for herself.</p>
            <p>If the power she steals is from a game series published from Planeptune (SEGA), Neptune will be able to use it with perfect efficiency.</p>
