            <p>Planeptune's super awesome CPU Candidate, and Neptune's awesome little sis! She may not have Neptune's super overpowered protag ruleset, but she's definitely getting there!</p>
            <p>She's usually working on gadgets to assist herself and the others, oooor just to have fun with.</p>
            <p>She uses her trusty Beam Sword to fight, and she looks pretty cool while she's doing it, as well!</p>
